                Happy Birthday Sissy!

              A little special birthday present website for you! I'm deep in debt to Mom and Dad and owe my first rent payment at the end of this month. 
              I don't have the money to get you something special right now. 
            </p>
            <h2>
                "My Birthday Was A Month Ago..?"
            </h2>
            <p>
                Yeah sorry about that. I was being murdered by final projects around your birthday. 
                I'm done with all the course work I needed done for this semester now! 
                I just finished coding an entire shopping website and database for one of my classes, which gave me some knowledge on how to make simple websites.
            </p>
            <h2>
                What Does This Website Do?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Not that much really. <strong>BUT</strong> I hope you'll enjoy it for a couple of minutes before it never sees the light of day again. 
                I'll explain some probability distributions to you that will hopefully answer all your "what is the probability of this happening if these things happen" questions!
                Again, I may be broke but I got semi-useful college knowledge now!
